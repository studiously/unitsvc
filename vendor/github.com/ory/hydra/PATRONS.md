We are proud to be part of the Open Knowledge and Open Source movement.
We have been using Open Source Software throughout our career and want to contribute back.
We believe that developers and operators should not have to fiddle with hard to understand configuration files,
runtime and installation. Our vision is to enhance the developer and operator ecosystem with easy to use
and secure Open Source Software, and we need your help to achieve that!
